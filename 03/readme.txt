One program (Incremental Construction Algorithm implementation):
1. TrapezoidalMap.java

Required system arguments (command line arguments):
1. input filename (e.g. ml3406.txt)

Input files should be in the same form as the provided sample file's.

Libraries used:
1. java.io.*;
2. java.util.*;

Output filename (hardcoded): Adjacency Matrix.txt

P.S. The code fixing trapezoids is optimized by the IDE, but it became a bit less readable.
